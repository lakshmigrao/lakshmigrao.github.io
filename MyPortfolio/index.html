		<h3>WELCOME TO LAKSHMI'S HOMEPAGE</h3>
		 <i>Hi all, My name is Lakshmi. I am born and brought up in India. I am a computer science graduate and worked for a shorter time in India. And then moved to Norway, Germany and then now to US for my husband's job. I took a break from working to travel and take care of the family.  <p class="disp1"> Maths </p> was my favorite subject in school. I love to do <p class="disp1"> Maths </p> puzzles in my free time.  Now the time has come to pursue my career. I have always loved programming and I am very excited to learn and grow with our PERSCHOLAS team.</i>

	<p id="german"> I lived in Germany for few years as my husband was working there. I got a chance to experience the culture and learn new things everyday. I also learned German language. It was difficult to start with, but once I started having conversations, I was really enjoying it. </p>
